# Migrate an existing customer database

If you want to integrate Zaikio into an existing application, you need to ask yourself how to map people and organizations securely and distinctively in your application.

If possible, we recommend not to map persons, but organizations. However, if you do not have any type of organization in your system, you can also transfer this guide for people.

## Step 1: Add a Zaikio Organization UUID to your database table

## Step 2: Add Zaikio SSO for users that belong to a mapped organization

Coming soon

## Step 3: Invite your organizations to join Zaikio
